<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

I'm working on this in my spare time, to help get me on the road a bit quicker please Consider supporting me via my KoFi link:
ko-fi.com/stuartmellor. Also, while these are aspects that I propose might be useful, I'm more than willing to listen and update this list:


- [x] Automatically generated sliders from RNBO patch paramaters.
- [ ] Connect sensors to RNBO patch (90% there already but omitted from this clean build).
- [ ] Explore recording (aka sampling) via onboard mics.
- [ ] etc. Let me know if you have any ideas!

# Max-MSP-RNBO-CPP-Native-Android

This project is one of a series of primitive experiments with the export functionality recently made
accessible in Max MSP via "RNBO". This particular project explores the deployment of an exported
RNBO project as an Android app.
